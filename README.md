# Meet Arnav 👋

Hi, I am Arnav, a Computer Science and Engineering student at Manipal Institute of Technology, Bengaluru. I have recently begun programming and have sufficient knowledge to code in C, Python, C++, HTML and CSS. I generally prefer working on the front-end of websites and enjoy solving programming problems as a passion. You can explore some of the projects I have worked on through my repositories.
